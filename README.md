# V-Login

## Architecture & Technology

Our solution is based on **browserless**, a Docker container that provides a fully functional headless browser (NSTChrome) and can be accessed via a WebSocket endpoint. Instead of launching a new browser for every request, browserless efficiently manages multiple browser sessions so that only the necessary instances are activated "on demand".

### How Does Browserless Work?

- **Remote DevTools & WebSocket API:**  
  Browserless offers an API that is accessed via WebSockets. This allows remote control of the browser using the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Our application connects to this endpoint to start a browser session and use it for automated tasks.

- **Efficient Session Management:**  
  Instead of launching a complete browser for every single request, browserless manages browser sessions internally. This conserves resources and enables a fast, scalable automation setup.

- **Validated Fingerprints:**  
  The nstbrowser project includes a database of valid fingerprints and knows how to obfuscate them. This ensures that automated processes appear as human-like as possible and minimizes the chance of being blocked (e.g., by Imperva).

### Why Is This Ideal for Automation?

- **Resource Efficient:**  
  Because browserless manages multiple sessions within a single container, resources are used efficiently and separate browser instances do not have to be launched for every request.

- **Fast Response Times:**  
  Using the WebSocket API enables near-instant control of the browser, which, combined with optimized fingerprints, leads to fast and reliable automations.

- **Flexibility and Scalability:**  
  The modular architecture allows for the easy integration of additional workflows (e.g., dynamic fingerprinting and IP management). This makes the system well-suited for complex automation scenarios.

This architecture makes our solution particularly powerful â€“ ideal for automated authentications, data extraction, and other tasks that require reliable browser interactions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following prerequisites are met on your system:

- Node.js (recommended: the latest LTS version)
- Docker

## Installation

Follow these steps in the given order to install and run the application:

1. **Install pnpm**

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
Install Dependencies

bash

pnpm install
Start the Browserless Docker Container

Replace the TOKEN and PORT values if necessary:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -e TOKEN=110e2d21-efc4-44e5-853a-9ce4099c81e1 -e PORT=8848 -p 8848:8848 --name browserless nstbrowser/browserless:130-202411051500.v2
This container is required to provide Chrome/Puppeteer instances via a WebSocket endpoint.

Build the V-Login Docker Image

```bash

sudo docker build -t v-login .
Start the V-Login Docker Container

This command runs the container in the host network and removes it automatically when it stops:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --network="host" v-login
